<h3 class="section">1.1 Fat-free Accounting</h3>

<p>Ledger is an accounting tool with the moxie to exist.  It provides no
bells or whistles, and returns the user to the days before user
interfaces were even a twinkling in their father&rsquo;s CRT.
</p>
<p>What it does offer is a double-entry accounting journal with all the
flexibility and muscle of its modern day cousins, without any of the
fat.  Think of it as the Bran Muffin of accounting tools.
</p>
<p>To use it, you need to start keeping a journal.  This is the basis of
all accounting, and if you haven&rsquo;t started yet, now is the time to
learn.  The little booklet that comes with your checkbook is a journal,
so we&rsquo;ll describe double-entry accounting in terms of that.
</p>

<p>A checkbook journal records debits (subtractions, or withdrawals) and
credits (additions, or deposits) with reference to a single account:
the checking account.  Where the money comes from, and where it goes
to, are described in the payee field, where you write the person or
company&rsquo;s name.  The ultimate aim of keeping a checkbook journal is to
know how much money is available to spend.  That&rsquo;s really the aim of
all journals.
</p>
<a name="index-postings"></a>
<p>What computers add is the ability to walk through these postings,
and tell you things about your spending habits; to let you devise
budgets and get control over your spending; to squirrel away money
into virtual savings account without having to physically move money
around; etc.  As you keep your journal, you are recording information
about your life and habits, and sometimes that information can start
telling you things you aren&rsquo;t aware of.  Such is the aim of all good
accounting tools.
</p>
<p>The next step up from a checkbook journal, is a journal that keeps
track of all your accounts, not just checking.  In such a journal, you
record not only who gets paid&mdash;in the case of a debit&mdash;but where the
money came from.  In a checkbook journal, it&rsquo;s assumed that all the
money comes from your checking account.  But in a general journal, you
write postings in two lines: the source account and target account.
<em>There must always be a debit from at least one account for every
credit made to another account</em>.
